    <pre>
        Salon der Limbo is a monthly chill out night
        from the DJs behind 
        No Other Day 
        and Ambient Brunch at Mustache.
        Audio will be downtempo, breakbeat,
        ambient, abstract, trance, etc etc..
        dance-able but highly textural and laid back sounds
        inspired by the millenial ultra-lounge. 
        Visuals will be heavily featured from 11xO artists
        and sets will be recorded for perpetuity.
        Rotating guest DJs will be included that fit the vibe.
        The idea riffs on recent trends towards Y2K aesthetics,
        but with less of the new age bend and more cyber-psychedelia
        and liminal dissociation.
